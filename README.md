The program is made using my custom logic. Here's how it works:

1 - Input plain text's length is multiplied by a randomly generated multiplier

2 - The final number is used to generate a long string of gibberish text

3 - The actual input text is dissected and each character is randomly placed into the gibberish text

4 - A flag system is implemented so 2 characters cannot be placed in the same position

5 - A key is generated with the position of each character

The cipher text and encryption key is returned to the user.

This program is easy to implement in other projects to allow for secure storage of text.
